## Overview
MadLibs are a fun way to engage a group of any age. (MadLibs Project Name) expands the experience to make it more personal. Any story can be turned into a madlib using (Project Name). Users can select from or submit their own stories, and (Project Name) does the work of selecting at random the best words to transform into prompts. Not only does this make the experience for the user more personal, but also makes every story different every time. When the story is complete, the app reads the story back to the group.
